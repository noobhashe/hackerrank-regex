Note: If you want to match (.) in the test string, you need to escape the dot by using a slash \..
In Java, use \\. instead of \..

Task

You have a test string .
Your task is to write a regular expression that matches only and exactly strings of form: , where each variable  can be any single character except the newline.

Note

This is a regex only challenge. You are not required to write any code.
You only have to fill in the regex pattern in the blank (_________).

Solution

regex_pattern = r"^.{3}\..{3}\..{3}\..{3}$"	# Do not delete 'r'.

import re
import sys

test_string = raw_input()

match = re.match(regex_pattern, test_string) is not None

print str(match).lower()
